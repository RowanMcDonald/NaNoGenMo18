This is the repo tracking my efforts during NaNoGenMo 2018

my issue: https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018/issues/45


## Process
As mentioned in this issue my process will break down with the following steps:

1. Find some points of inspiration by reading past resources
				This seems particularly important and likely what I will spend the first 
				week or so doing.  I have vanishingly little exposure to the field of generative
				text and thus have no inclination as to what a non-trivial project might be.

1. Choose a piece of tech to work with
				It seems like a common language choice is python, probably due to the 
				availible libraries (at least to some extent). My language choice depends
				on the techniques chosen during the investigation/inspiration phase. Given
				my familiarity, I'd default to ruby, but if there's a cool library or I need
				intensive performance.

1. Implementate it
